# ShortestTripToEarthUIScale
1.25x UI Scale Mod for Shortest Trip to Earth

## Description
This mod forces the Shortest Trip to Earth UI to 1.25x.  This does not affect the save settings and the UI's scale setting is completely ignored.

Compatible with 1.0.11


## Installation
- Download BepinEx (used to load the mod into the game)  https://builds.bepis.io/builds/bepinex_be/BepInEx_x64_31b53d3_5.0.0.144.zip
- Extract the contents of the BepinEx .zip file into the Shortest Trip to Earth directory
  - The game is generally located in the Steam Install Directory at steamapps\common\Shortest Trip to Earth
- Download the StteUiScale.dll ( https://github.com/NBKRedSpy/ShortestTripToEarthUIScale/releases/download/v1.0/StteUiScale.dll ) and copy to the BepInEx plugin directory
  - For example (steamapps\common\Shortest Trip to Earth\BepInEx\plugins)

## Finished
At this point, the UI will be fixed at 1.25x scale and changing the UI scale in the settings will have no effect.
